# Memory Game Project
The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating my skills of JavaScript. I built a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration). But this isn’t just any memory game! It’s a shnazzy, well-designed, feature-packed memory game!

## Getting Started
Downloading the zip file or clone via Github

## Prerequisites
You will only need your browser and good internet connection.

#### How To Play
1. When you open the game a 4*4 grid will open
1. Click to match 2 cells at a time 
1. If you have a match, the 2 cells will still open and if not they will flip.
1. If you managed to match all the cells, you win and you will be able to see the number of moves you made and the time you took. 

#### Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
